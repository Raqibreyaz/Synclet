# 🧠 Synclet – Efficient, Event-Driven File Sync Without Polling Waste

> **"A no-nonsense, performant file syncing engine that thinks in diffs and sleeps when idle."**

## 🚀 Why Synclet?

Tired of constant polling? So were we.
Tired of syncing whole files just because 2 bytes changed? Same here.

**Synclet** is built to **sync files precisely**, using **content-defined chunking**, **event-driven notifications**, and **peer-based snapshots**, all without wasting cycles.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* 💤 **No Polling** – Uses `inotify` + `epoll` to only wake up when something changes.
* 🧩 **Smart Chunk Sync** – Breaks files into logical chunks using rolling hashes, syncing only what’s needed.
* 🧠 **Snapshot Hashing** – 32-byte global snapshot versioning detects even the smallest file change across machines.
* 🔄 **Two-Way Syncing** – Automatically detects if peer is ahead or behind, then fetches or sends.
* 📦 **Binary-safe Transfers** – No corruption, even in weird chunk boundaries. Everything's binary-packed.
* 📂 **Recursive Directory Tracking** – Watches all nested directories efficiently.
* 🛠️ **Protocol-Based Events** – From `FILE_CREATE` to `MODIFIED_CHUNK`, your peer always knows what's happening.
* 📊 **Progress Tracking** – Visual indicators of how much sync has completed.

## 🧬 How It Works

### 🔹 Snapshot Creation

Each file is chunked using **rolling Rabin-Karp hashes**:

* A window slides over bytes.
* If `hash % N == 0`, a chunk boundary is marked.
* SHA-256 ensures strong uniqueness of each chunk.

> ✅ **CDC over fixed-size**: Fixed-size fails for small inserts — everything shifts. Not here.

### 🔹 Event-Driven Sync

* Uses `inotify + epoll` to watch files/dirs non-blockingly.
* File events (`modify`, `create`, `move`, `delete`) are captured **instantly**, no polling.

### 🔹 Efficient Network Protocol

Your protocol isn't ad-hoc. It's designed like this:

```json
TYPE: MODIFIED_CHUNK
PAYLOAD: {
  filename, offset, chunk_size, old_chunk_size, is_last_chunk
}
```

> 🔗 All operations are structured via typed messages + raw data when required.

### 🔹 Initial Sync Logic

* Peers exchange `snap-version` hashes.
* If versions differ:

  * Only the required chunks/files are transferred.
  * Supports downloading missed changes **or** pushing local changes back.

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
make client   # Builds the client binary in ./client/output
make server   # Builds the server binary in ./server/output
```

## 🔬 Developer Logs (a few highlights)

> See [`dev-logs.txt`](./dev-logs.txt) for more

* ✅ **Reduced polling overhead** using `inotify` instead of file scan loops.
* ✅ **Chunking optimization** from char-by-char to buffer-based reads to reduce syscalls.
* ✅ **Smart rename detection** using `cookie` and timestamps.
* ✅ **Snap versioning** to avoid sending full snapshot every time.
* ✅ **Progress bar** for user feedback.
* ✅ **File sanitization** to avoid invalid chars in saved chunks.

## 📁 Blueprint Insights

All low-level strategies, from CDC algorithms to protocol structure, are in [`blue-print.txt`](./blue-print.txt). Here’s a glimpse:

* 🔍 **Hybrid Chunk Hashing**: Rolling hash to detect chunk boundary, SHA-256 to fingerprint.
* 🔐 **Binary Chunk Storage**: Metadata and data are stored in raw `.bin` files with custom structure.
* 📤 **Ordered Set for Chunks**: Ensures deterministic file reconstructions from random chunk delivery order.
* 🕵️ **Rename detection**: Paired `IN_MOVED_FROM`/`IN_MOVED_TO` using 200ms time window.

## ❤️ Built For

Engineers who hate noisy logs, wasted CPU cycles, or bloated tools — and want **clarity**, **control**, and **clean syncing logic**.
